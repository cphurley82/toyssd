# toyssdConfig.cmake - CMake package configuration for toyssd
#
# Usage (consumer):
#   find_package(toyssd CONFIG REQUIRED)
#   target_link_libraries(<your_target> PRIVATE toyssd::ssdsim)   # public C API
#   # Optionally, link to toyssd::simlib if you need deeper integration with
#   # simulator internals (headers installed under include/toyssd/sim).
#
# This config simply loads the exported targets generated during installation
# (toyssdTargets.cmake). Transitive dependencies like SystemC are propagated
# via the targets' link interfaces.
# TODO: Is this needed? One day we may wan to package the simulator separately
# from the firmware, but for now this seems like unnecessary complexity.
